## Current Development Priority

### Immediate Next Steps (Next 2-3 days)
1. **Complete Mobile App Foundation**
   - Implement Context Providers
   - Create basic screen layouts
   - Set up location services

2. **Backend API Implementation**
   - Complete authentication routes
   - Implement trip management endpoints
   - Add location services

3. **Database Integration**
   - Set up PostgreSQL with PostGIS
   - Run database migrations
   - Test CRUD operations

### Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + PostGIS
   - Mobile: React Native + TypeScript
   - Admin: React.js (to be implemented)

2. **Architecture Patterns**
   - RESTful API design
   - Context-based state management
   - Microservice-ready structure

3. **Security & Privacy**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - End-to-end data encryption
   - Granular consent management
   - GDPR compliance features

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Node.js and npm
node --version  # >= 16.0.0
npm --version   # >= 8.0.0

# React Native CLI
npm install -g react-native-cli

# PostgreSQL with PostGIS
# Install PostgreSQL 14+ with PostGIS extension

# Android Studio (for Android development)
# Xcode (for iOS development on macOS)
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
npm run dev
```

### Mobile App Setup
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm install
# For Android
npm run android
# For iOS (macOS only)
npm run ios
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# Create database
createdb natpac_travel_db

# Run in psql
CREATE USER natpac_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE natpac_travel_db TO natpac_user;

# Run migrations (once backend is complete)
npm run db:setup
```
